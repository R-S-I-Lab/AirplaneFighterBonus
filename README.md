# AirplaneFighterBonus
In this game, you control an airplane flying forward while avoiding incoming obstacles by moving left or right. If the airplane collides with an obstacle, the game ends. The plane has the ability to fire projectiles at obstacles in front of it and destroy them. Your score is based on number of obstacles destroyed.
